# React Redux To-Do Application

This project is a simple To-Do application built using ReactJS and Redux. It allows users to add, view, and delete tasks, as well as mark them as completed.

## Features

- Add tasks: Users can input tasks into a text field and add them to the list.
- View tasks: All added tasks are displayed in a list format.
- Delete tasks: Each task has a delete button to remove it from the list.
- Mark tasks as completed: Users can mark tasks as completed without deleting them, toggling their completion status.
- Persistent storage: Tasks are saved to local storage, ensuring they are not lost on page reload.

## Technologies Used

- ReactJS: For building the user interface and components.
